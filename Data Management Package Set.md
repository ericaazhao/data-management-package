# Data Management Package Set

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data management solution designed to securely transfer, sanitize, minimize, and restore production data for use in non-production environments. By leveraging Apache Airflow for workflow automation, it ensures secure, scalable, and efficient data handling across different environments (development, staging, testing).

### Why This Project Matters

1. **Data Security**: Prevents sensitive data exposure during testing or development by implementing robust sanitization and obfuscation techniques.
2. **Cost Optimization**: Reduces data storage and processing costs by minimizing datasets without losing functionality.
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) by anonymizing and masking data fields.

## Key Features

1. **Rules Engine**: A customizable engine that defines data transfer rules, enabling flexibility in what data is copied and how it is processed.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - **Sanitization**: Cleans data by removing irrelevant or redundant information.
   - **Obfuscation**: Masks sensitive data fields to ensure privacy.
   - **Minimization**: Reduces dataset size while preserving critical functionality.
3. **Workflow Automation**: Apache Airflow automates the entire process, including data transfer, transformation, and restoration.
4. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Allows tailoring of database configurations for development, staging, and testing environments.

## Competitor Analysis

This section highlights the strengths and weaknesses of three leading competitors in the data management space. These tools are widely regarded for their capabilities but also come with certain trade-offs, making a custom-built solution valuable.

### **1. Microsoft Azure DevTest Labs**
